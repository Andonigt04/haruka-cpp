// STABLE ABI between the DGS HOST (which dlopens) and the per-project RULES MODULE (.so).
//
// Goal (see the game's PLAN_DGS_ANTICHEAT docs): the DGS is GENERIC and is never edited per game.
// Each project ships its lib<project>_rules.so exporting `dgs_game_module_v1()`; the DGS delegates
// ALL game semantics to it (physics, casting, what moves, world editing). The same code is compiled
// statically into the CLIENT (prediction) and as a .so for the DGS (validation) → identical rules.
//
// Versioning: if the ABI breaks, add `dgs_game_module_v2()` (a new symbol); the core is NOT edited.
// F0: validateMove only (replicating the historical validate()). F1+: validateAction, step, serialize…
