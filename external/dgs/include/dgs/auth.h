// Who is allowed to be a NODE.
//
// Nothing between the nodes was authenticated. Anyone who could reach the head's TCP port could send a
// `PKT_METRICS` and be registered as a zone — and the head then ROUTES ENTITIES TO IT: reassignments,
// entity state, region blobs. The same for the validator (send verdicts), for persistence (write to
// the database, and now read it back) and for the social node (issue bans). Not one of those ports
// asked a single question.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. A connector proves it holds the cluster secret by sending, immediately after
// connecting, a `PKT_AUTH` carrying a random nonce, a timestamp and
// `HMAC-SHA256(secret, nonce || timestamp)`. The listener checks the MAC, that the timestamp is inside
// a window, and that the nonce has not been seen before. The secret itself never travels.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT, and it matters more than what it is:
//   · it is NOT TLS. The rest of the connection is in clear: anyone on the path still reads every
//     packet and can modify them. This decides WHO MAY CONNECT, not what is confidential.
//   · it authenticates the CONNECTION, not each packet. Someone who can inject into an established
//     TCP stream is not stopped by it.
//   · the replay window is bounded by the timestamp and the seen-nonce cache, not by a challenge, so
//     a captured packet is useless after the window and useless twice inside it — but a full
//     challenge-response would be stronger.
// The real answer is mTLS or a private network for the control plane. This is the floor.
//
// ⚠️ UNSET MEANS DISABLED, and that is a deliberate, uncomfortable choice. Fail-closed is right for
// the observer feed (an optional debug stream: refusing costs nothing) and wrong here, where refusing
// means no cluster starts at all — a default that bricks every existing deployment on upgrade is an
// outage, not a security improvement. So `DGS_CLUSTER_SECRET` unset leaves the ports open and every
// node SAYS SO, loudly, on the line right after it starts listening.
